			"During his freshman year of high school, Jackson began experiencing gender dysphoria — an intense feeling that he was in the wrong body. \"It’s like this inner voice fighting you, almost,\" Jackson said. \"Every time I would see a guy, I would just compare myself to him, and the ways that I’m not like him or I’d never be like him.\" Worried about his mental health, that school year he first told his friends that he was a boy, and his mom later on.",
			"Now, a year later, Jackson has made major strides in his transition. He cut off his hair and started seeing a gender therapist. He changed his name to Jackson and started going by male pronouns. In April, he had his first testosterone shot, and this summer he will legally change his name and gender marker. \"The transition is more how to be comfortable with yourself, how to be grateful for what you have versus comparing what you have to other people and naming everything that’s wrong with your life,\" Jackson said. \"It’s just being comfortable in your own skin.\""

			"For Adam, gender identity and gender expression are distinct from each other. He’s a transgender young man, but he also has created elaborate makeup looks and loves to dye his hair. \"As soon as a trans guy wears makeup, they’d be like, ‘Are you de-transitioning now? Huh? You want to be a girl again?’\" Adam said. \"It’s really annoying because you still have to confine to gender roles either way.\"",
			"Last year, Adam dropped out of his high school, where he found acceptance from some but was still treated as a girl by others. Since then, he has been waiting until his family has enough money for him to get his GED, start taking hormones and legally change his name and gender marker."

By then, she identified as gender fluid, meaning she did not feel her gender was fixed. Previously, she had been out as gay. Over the course of a few years, she changed her name to Sasha and began using the pronouns \"she\" and \"they\" interchangeably.",
			"Though she didn’t always fit in with peers at school, Sasha’s family was immediately accepting of her. Her father is transgender, her mother is bisexual and her stepfather is queer, an umbrella term for those who do not identify as solely heterosexual. She went to Pride events essentially from birth. \"I really come from an LGBT family,\" she said. \"I think the hardest thing of coming out was just coming out to people who weren’t related to me.\""

All she wanted was to be able to wear makeup and the clothing she wanted, but tensions with her adoptive mother led to her running away repeatedly before being placed in the foster care system.",
			"At 16, Catizia finally found a family who loved her for who she is, and a mother who is a transgender woman, too. In the process, she let go of much of the anger that used to plague her. \"It’s tough for a lot of trans people out there, to go through the exact same thing I go through,\" Catizia said. \"I just always told myself that it gets better, and it did.\""

			"For a while, his relationship with his father was rocky. And even though his mother, Belinda Trevino, came out at 35 as a gay woman, she still struggled at first with her son’s transition. \"He’s erasing — not to say it in a bad way — but erasing my baby girl,\" Belinda said. Realizing there were few resources for the parents of transgender youth, Belinda founded the support group Be Human, first in Corpus Christi and then in San Antonio when she moved, so parents could share their experiences with each other."

He’s now in treatment, which has helped him to better cope, and recently started hormone therapy. Jaime’s mother works in San Antonio, where he also attends Fiesta Youth, a LGBTQ peer support group. There, Jaime found supportive friends. \"I came to the right place,\" he said."

She wished that people would also pay attention to the fact that she’s artistic and aspires to be a cartoonist one day, or that she loves to read. \"Being trans means to me just being myself and just existing as myself,\" Treci said. \"That’s pretty much it. It just embodies who I am, as far as gender goes. But it’s not the most defining part about me.\""

But he has felt uncomfortable about formally telling classmates and teachers, worried that his peers would make assumptions about him or think of him differently. \"I’m just not sure what will happen,\" Will said in the fall. \"I guess I’m afraid.\" For that reason, the Express-News is identifying him only by his first name. He decided to come out first at a church where he volunteers, changing his name tag to reflect his new name.",
