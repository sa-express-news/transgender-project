The group was gathered at St. Jude\u2019s Ranch for Children, a home for abused and neglected youth north of San Antonio in Bulverde, situated on a picturesque campus, grassy and lush with trees. For a couple years, Lauryn, a 57-year-old transgender woman, had mentored LGBTQ youth in the foster care system, as part of her broader advocacy for transgender rights in Texas. And so Lauryn had made the hourlong drive to participate in a \u201ccircle of support,\u201d a meeting meant to connect children with a network of adults as they approach the cutoff for aging out of foster care.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">This time, the session was for a sophomore at Smithson Valley High School, a transgender girl who went by Izzy, short for Catizia. As the discussion got underway, the group \u2014 which included a Child Protective Services caseworker, the ranch\u2019s case manager and a transition specialist \u2014 began chastising Catizia for her falling grades. Curious, Lauryn asked her to describe the environment at school.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">Catizia told them how once a teacher asked her in front of the class, \u201cSo, does everybody know your secret?\u201d She told them that when the other kids at school found out she was transgender, they hurled water bottles and the insult \u201ctranny\u201d at her. She told them how she was only allowed to use the nurse\u2019s restroom, difficult to access in such a big school. She told them how at times she was so embarrassed that she wouldn\u2019t go to the bathroom at all during the school day. On top of that, Catizia\u2019s therapist had recommended that she begin hormone therapy, but it was doubtful that her adoptive mother, who had kicked her out of the house multiple times for wearing makeup and girls\u2019 clothing, would consent to the treatment.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">After hearing all this, Lauryn said in a loud voice, \u201cWell maybe she should just come live with us.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">\u201cWell maybe she should,\u201d the caseworker replied.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">In that moment, Lauryn\u2019s emotions may have gotten the better of her, but those words would be pivotal for her, and for Catizia. Lauryn and her wife quickly became certified as foster parents, and they soon welcomed Catizia into their home. Under one roof over the next few years, two generations of trans women would learn from one another, from the pain and hardships each had endured. \u201cHaving had the opportunity to be a parent of a younger transgender woman, it\u2019s really opened my eyes to myself and to what I went through, and that\u2019s the reason we do it,\u201d Lauryn said of her advocacy. \u201cIt\u2019s for the kids, it\u2019s for the younger ones, so they can live as who they are, as soon as they know who they are.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"> </p><atavist-simple-image class=\"atavist-simple-image atavist-shared atavist-block atavist-block-align-full\" data-assets=\"https://atavist.com/data/files/organization/61567/image/derivative/scale~1200x0~20170513tra-1496269151-73.jpg,https://atavist.com/data/files/organization/61567/image/derivative/scale~800x0~20170513tra-1496269151-73.jpg,https://atavist.com/data/files/organization/61567/image/derivative/scale~400x0~20170513tra-1496269151-73.jpg\" contenteditable=\"false\" atavist-block=\"true\" block_id=\"1520990\" block_type=\"atavist-simple-image\" audio_color_scheme=\"white\" the_image=\"{&quot;temp_path&quot;:null,&quot;filename&quot;:&quot;20170513tra-1496269151-73.jpg&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:5760,&quot;height&quot;:3840,&quot;focal_point&quot;:{&quot;x&quot;:50,&quot;y&quot;:50},&quot;progress&quot;:0,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/data/files/organization/61567/image/raw/20170513tra-1496269151-73.jpg&quot;}\" the_caption=\"Lauryn Farris, in purple, her wife Kerry Farris and her daughter Catizia Farris play with her grandson Austin Farris outside the Landa Library in San Antonio, Texas on May 13, 2017.\" data-alignment=\"full\"></atavist-simple-image><p class=\"text-centered\" style=\"\"><b>***</b></p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\"><b>From an early age,</b> Lauryn knew what it felt like to be different.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">She was identified male at birth, with three fingers on one hand. By the age of 3, she was playing with her mother\u2019s make-up, not yet able to articulate how she felt. When she was 5, she told a cousin that she should have been born a girl. He beat her up. After that, she kept her secret to herself, not confiding in anyone again until after high school.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">By then, Lauryn, who was not yet out, was majoring in history and education at Eastern Michigan University, where she would eventually become study body president. It was there that she also met her future wife, Kerry, who she would date on and off. Early on in their relationship, Lauryn told Kerry about her desire to dress as a woman. Once, they even went out together while Lauryn wore women\u2019s clothing. Kerry, who came from a conservative family and spent much of her childhood in Richmond, felt deeply uncomfortable, afraid of what might happen. Back then, it was not something that was talked about openly, and there was no Internet to covertly consult for more information. Kerry dismissed the behavior as a phase that would eventually pass.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">On Halloween night in 1980, the two had argued. Kerry stayed at her dorm, while Lauryn went to a party with friends. After grabbing a late-night meal, Lauryn and four friends were on their way home when a drunk driver slammed head-on into their car. Police found Lauryn embedded in the windshield, with extensive injuries to her chest and throat. She was initially pronounced dead at the scene. Three others in her car would die from their injuries.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">Miraculously, emergency responders managed to revive Lauryn. She spent months in the hospital, undergoing reconstructive facial surgery. All her front teeth needed to be replaced, and doctors had to rewire her broken jaw. The insertion of breathing tubes down her throat had permanently damaged her vocal cords, and her face was scarred. But she was alive. It wasn\u2019t until later that Lauryn considered that she might have been brought back to life for a reason.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">Two years later, the couple decided it was time to commit and settle down. They wed in Michigan on July 3, 1982. After moving around several times in Texas, in April 1985 they finally settled for good in San Antonio.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">For a time, Lauryn\u2019s identity faded somewhat into the background. Kerry worked as an educational diagnostician at a public school district, while Lauryn traveled constantly as a project manager for a software company. Kerry knew Lauryn frequented a cross-dressing group, but that was the extent of what they discussed. She suspected that her husband hid things from her, but she still wanted children, a family. They welcomed two sons, Mark and Harold.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">Before returning home from outings with the LGBTQ community, Lauryn typically changed back into men\u2019s clothing. But one night when she didn\u2019t, she was spotted by their next-door-neighbor, who was also their babysitter. Unable to admit the truth, Kerry tried to convince her that she must have been dreaming.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p class=\"text-centered\" style=\"\"><b>***</b></p><p style=\"\"> </p><atavist-simple-image class=\"atavist-simple-image atavist-shared atavist-block atavist-block-align-full\" data-assets=\"https://atavist.com/data/files/organization/61567/image/derivative/scale~1200x0~20170513tra-1496336455-48.jpg,https://atavist.com/data/files/organization/61567/image/derivative/scale~800x0~20170513tra-1496336455-48.jpg,https://atavist.com/data/files/organization/61567/image/derivative/scale~400x0~20170513tra-1496336455-48.jpg\" contenteditable=\"false\" atavist-block=\"true\" block_id=\"1522337\" block_type=\"atavist-simple-image\" audio_color_scheme=\"white\" the_image=\"{&quot;temp_path&quot;:null,&quot;filename&quot;:&quot;20170513tra-1496336455-48.jpg&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:5760,&quot;height&quot;:3840,&quot;focal_point&quot;:{&quot;x&quot;:50,&quot;y&quot;:50},&quot;progress&quot;:0,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/data/files/organization/61567/image/raw/20170513tra-1496336455-48.jpg&quot;}\" the_caption=\"Kerry Farris holds her grandson Austin Farris as Lauryn Farris puts shoes on Austin at a Sketchers Outlet store in San Antonio, Texas on May 13, 2017.\" data-alignment=\"full\"></atavist-simple-image><p style=\"\"><br></p><p style=\"\"><b>By the 1990s,</b> Lauryn was on the road as much as ever, and when she wasn\u2019t working, she was drinking heavily. When she would go out, Kerry often would not know where she was. In May 1990, Lauryn got into an accident and was charged with driving under the influence. Eventually, Kerry could no longer handle the drinking, and the couple went into counseling. But by 1995 they decided they would both be better off apart. The split was so friendly that their lawyer remarked that he had never seen such an amicable divorce. During the summers after that, the family still vacationed together, planning trips near wherever Lauryn was based for work at the time. Lauryn began dating someone and moved to Dallas.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">In 1997, Lauryn had an epiphany. While attending Easter Mass at Cathedral of Hope, an LGBTQ-friendly church in Dallas, the reverend told the congregation, \u201cAll are worthy. All are welcome.\u201d In that moment, Lauryn realized that others, and God, could love her just as she was \u2014 in fact, she\u2019d been made that way for a reason. She\u2019d been brought back from near-death for a reason. And she had been unable to accept herself. From that day forward, she said she never struggled with alcohol again.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">Over time, Lauryn and Kerry began talking more, and they reconnected. In March 2000, they remarried.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">After that, Lauryn gradually began her transition. She let her blonde hair, already on the long side, grow out even more, and visited nail salons. In late 2002, she began taking hormones. In Columbus, where she had a corporate apartment, she began making friends in the LGBTQ community. But Lauryn still struggled to openly talk with her wife \u2014 Kerry learned Lauryn had started hormones when she found them in a suitcase. And she was not yet out, full time, as a woman.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">Initially, their older son, Mark, was angry, upset that his parents hadn\u2019t told him about who Lauryn was. It felt as if they hadn\u2019t been truthful with him. It took time for him to understand and adjust to what in some ways was a new parent. Several years later, when Mark was getting married, Lauryn offered to wear a tuxedo at the wedding. Kerry disagreed \u2014 she thought Lauryn should dress as herself. For the ceremony, Kerry and Lauryn both wore sleek, floor-length gowns.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">By that time, Lauryn had already come out to those who mattered, with the support of her family. She had legally changed her name to Lauryn Harold Farris, and her gender marker to female. Their close friends largely accepted Lauryn.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">Then, over lunch, the couple told their pastor. \u201cYou know you\u2019ll never be able to take communion again,\u201d he told Lauryn, before turning to Kerry. She and the boys were still welcome, he said. Stunned, neither responded. The rejection seeped through Lauryn, overwhelming her with feelings of betrayal and ostracism. They wouldn\u2019t be going back to that church, Kerry silently resolved.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\"><br></p><p style=\"\">As Lauryn transitioned, Kerry felt they were closer than ever. Just as Lauryn was becoming her true self, Kerry felt she could do the same. They found they could be really good friends, as well as partners.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\"><br></p><p style=\"\">Occasionally, someone would ask Kerry whether Lauryn\u2019s transition meant she was now a lesbian. \u201cI\u2019m straight, but I\u2019m not narrow,\u201d became her common refrain, though she was not ashamed of the label. People could ask prying, inappropriate questions, but Kerry didn\u2019t feel as if it were that hard to understand. \u201cLove has no gender,\u201d Kerry would tell trusted coworkers. \u201cIf you love someone, it doesn\u2019t matter who they are or what sex they are.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><custom-block-591c997fca899 class=\"custom-block-591c997fca899 atavist-shared atavist-block atavist-block-align-center\" data-assets=\"\" contenteditable=\"false\" atavist-block=\"true\" block_id=\"1522137\" block_type=\"custom-block-591c997fca899\" font_size=\"2\" the_pullquote=\"\u201cLove has no gender.

She became involved with the Transgender Education Network of Texas, the San Antonio Gender Association and the Pride Center, among other organizations. Then, she offered to take Catizia in.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">The Farrises knew some things about Catizia\u2019s past, but they would not learn her full story until later, when they sat down one Saturday at CPS offices to sift through the towering stack of her records.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">As infants, Catizia and her two brothers were all addicted to drugs, a byproduct of their mother\u2019s heroin habit. Catizia\u2019s father was never in the picture. In 1998, their mother left Catizia, then three months old, and her older brother with friends. She never returned for them. A month after giving birth to Catizia\u2019s younger brother, she died in a car crash.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">A great aunt adopted the three children, but CPS continued to be a constant presence in their lives. Over the years, caseworkers visited frequently to investigate a host of allegations, including abuse, neglect, lacking supervision and refusing parental responsibility.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">Catizia and her adoptive mother had a fraught relationship, replete with arguments over Catizia\u2019s desire to wear eyeliner and skinny jeans, her seething anger and unhappiness. Her older brother heard their adoptive mother call Catizia weak, gay. At first, Catizia thought she was gay, too \u2014 she definitely didn\u2019t like girls. But from a young age, she also felt innately feminine. After watching a documentary about drag queens, she wondered what it would be like to be a girl, all the time.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">Running away became common. Sometimes Catizia left of her own volition, and sometimes she was forced out. Under the best circumstances, she would stay at a friend\u2019s house. Under the worst, she sought refuge in a nearby ditch.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">In 2011, when Catizia was 13, she began making strange statements at school, claiming that she was hearing voices and seeing things come out of the wall. Soon after, doctors diagnosed her with major depressive disorder, with psychotic features, and prescribed her several psychotropic medications.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">Later that year, things reached a boiling point. After yet another fight, this time over Catizia wanting to wear a cheerleading outfit for the pep squad, her adoptive mother decided she could no longer handle her and wanted the state to take custody. She drove Catizia to an emergency shelter near Balcones Heights, where the two got into another fight in the parking lot, this one physical. Police arrested Catizia for assault.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">From that day forward, she would not have a stable home again for years.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p class=\"text-centered\" style=\"\"><b>***</b></p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\"><b>For about a month,</b> Catizia stayed at the emergency shelter. Her next stop was a residential treatment center in Kerrville, where the staff took away her clothes and flatiron, and chopped off her long, dark hair.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">Housed alongside juvenile criminals, Catizia sensed there might be other trans and gay youth there. But staff warned her to stay quiet about her gender and sexuality, and told her they would help her make those thoughts go away. Two months later, she was moved to another residential treatment center, this time in Waco. Still on heavy medication, Catizia felt sluggish, like a zombie. She didn\u2019t feel as if she needed the medication, but she wanted to go home. She lost track of time.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">After five months in residential treatment, Catizia was placed back with her adoptive mother. Initially she was thrilled to be back with family, but it didn\u2019t last. Catizia ran away yet again, after it became clear her adoptive mother still didn\u2019t accept her.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">From there Catizia went to a foster home, with a woman who made jewelry for a living. For nearly a year, she attended Sam Houston High School and attended therapy. Doctors weaned her off her medications. Her life was stable for a while, but it never truly felt like a home. As the months dragged on, her adoptive mother made little progress with CPS services that would allow her to regain custody. Then, Catizia\u2019s foster mom erroneously told her that her adoptive mother\u2019s parental rights had been terminated, that she must not care much about Catizia.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">Worried about being sent back to residential treatment, in April 2013 Catizia left the house, as she had so many times before. This time, she didn\u2019t come back.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p class=\"text-centered\" style=\"\"><b>***</b></p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\"><b>Every day, Catizia would call</b> around to see where she could stay that night. She tried to meet up with friends, but sometimes she ended up with strangers. One woman she stayed with dealt methamphetamines out of a filthy, cockroach-infested house. Catizia left when the woman pulled a knife on her.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">At times, Catizia would walk aimlessly for hours on end, thirsty and hungry. Once, when she had some money, she boarded a bus and drifted off, exhausted. She awoke to find her backpack had been stolen. A group of girls was pointing and laughing at her.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">\u201cIs that a girl or is that a boy?\u201d they jeered.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">At some point, Catizia met a girl who had also been in foster care.

Catizia didn\u2019t know what that meant, but replied that she felt like a girl inside.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">\u201cWell, then you\u2019re trans,\u201d the girl said, offering her phone so Catizia could look it up. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of trans people out there.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"> </p><atavist-embed class=\"atavist-embed atavist-shared atavist-block atavist-block-align-center\" data-assets=\"\" contenteditable=\"false\" atavist-block=\"true\" block_id=\"1522522\" block_type=\"atavist-embed\" raw_embed=\"<iframe src=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Rggv7kYUSLCEvTLBqdwV11Gu325G-CQ_88vsAvrhzMY/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;569&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;></iframe>\" the_caption=\"\"></atavist-embed><p style=\"\"><br></p><p style=\"\">After four months on the streets, Catizia got in touch with a caseworker. When they met up at a bus stop in the Medical Center, Catizia looked like any other teenage girl. She wore lipstick, eyeliner, mascara and blush, and her hair was now shoulder length. She had been off her medication for months and felt she no longer needed it.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">Catizia tried to make things work at home, but her adoptive mother firmly prohibited makeup. She didn\u2019t believe anyone at school would acknowledge that Catizia was a girl. Catizia agreed to go back into foster care, but this time she had a few conditions. She wanted to wear women\u2019s clothing and makeup. She wanted a family that would accept her for who she was.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">Much to her caseworker\u2019s surprise, Catizia found that with an Air Force family. Her foster parents let her wear whatever she liked, and they agreed to call her Izzy. Catizia enrolled at Brennan High School and began attending gender therapy appointments. No longer on any medications, she felt happy and safe, for the first time in a long time.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">To Catizia\u2019s dismay, her foster family soon announced they would be moving back to Colorado because the father was leaving the Air Force.

A few days later, Lauryn began making calls to see if they could get their marriage license updated with her new name. The clerk would not change their current license, but they could issue a new one \u2014 if they got married again. Kerry agreed, as long as they did it on their anniversary; she couldn\u2019t remember yet another date.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">So on July 3, 2015, the 33rd anniversary of their first wedding, Lauryn and Kerry stood among the flowers in Landa Community Garden and, for the third time, committed themselves to each other.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p class=\"text-centered\" style=\"\"><b>***</b></p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\"><b>Lauryn carried these experiences</b> \u2014 her own, and Catizia\u2019s \u2014 with her as, again and again, she made the trip to Austin this legislative session.

Just like everyone else,\u201d Lauryn shouted, jabbing the air with her finger as she spoke.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">And she carried those experiences with her when she returned to Austin in April, to once again testify against legislation she considered discriminatory. Lauryn arrived at the capitol early that day, but it quickly became apparent that yet again she would be in Austin all night \u2014 the committee considering a House bathroom bill would not convene until that evening.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">Later on in the day, Lauryn took a seat in the room where testimony would be taken on a bill that would allow child welfare providers to decline services or referrals based on religious beliefs. It was the same room where she had testified after 2 a.m. the month before, against the Senate bathroom bill. Just as she did then, Lauryn sat there as minutes stretched into hours. She knew all too well that to be heard in Austin means waiting your turn. Knowing everything Catizia had been through, she couldn\u2019t stay silent. When Lauryn\u2019s turn came, she explained how Catizia had lived on the streets, how she ran away when she felt she had nowhere to turn, how a faith-based foster home had made things worse.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><atavist-simple-image class=\"atavist-simple-image atavist-shared atavist-block atavist-block-align-full\" data-assets=\"https://atavist.com/data/files/organization/61567/image/derivative/scale~1200x0~translobby-1496336157-8.jpg,https://atavist.com/data/files/organization/61567/image/derivative/scale~800x0~translobby-1496336157-8.jpg,https://atavist.com/data/files/organization/61567/image/derivative/scale~400x0~translobby-1496336157-8.jpg\" contenteditable=\"false\" atavist-block=\"true\" block_id=\"1522328\" block_type=\"atavist-simple-image\" data-alignment=\"full\" audio_color_scheme=\"white\" the_image=\"{&quot;temp_path&quot;:null,&quot;filename&quot;:&quot;translobby-1496336157-8.jpg&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:4212,&quot;height&quot;:3000,&quot;focal_point&quot;:{&quot;x&quot;:50,&quot;y&quot;:50},&quot;progress&quot;:0,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/data/files/organization/61567/image/raw/translobby-1496336157-8.jpg&quot;}\" the_caption=\"Laurlyn Farris, smiles at a friend during a meeting before a gathering at the State Capitol during Trans Texas Lobby Day in Austin, TX on Monday, March 6, 2017. (Bob Owen, San Antonio Express-news0\"></atavist-simple-image><p style=\"\"><br></p><p style=\"\">Almost nine hours later, at 2:42 a.m., Lauryn walked up to the lectern to explain how she began transitioning at a time when transgender people were afraid of bathrooms. The bill, she said, would condemn the next generation of trans kids to suffering as she had. \u201cBecause of the era I grew up in, I have serious kidney disease, and I have it because I didn\u2019t pee. I was afraid to go pee. I was afraid to go pee anywhere,\u201d Lauryn said. \u201cNow, when we leave San Antonio, my stunningly beautiful, model daughter, when we leave San Antonio, I have to make her use the bathroom.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">She wouldn\u2019t get home until 4:30 a.m.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p class=\"text-centered\" style=\"\"><b>***</b></p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\"><b>Over the next month,</b> even as both bathroom bills stalled, the issue continued to plague the Texas Legislature. Lauryn continued to speak on conference calls about legislation that would impact LGBTQ Texans, but the hits kept coming. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick threatened to force a special session over bathrooms and property taxes, while Gov. Greg Abbott repeatedly called for legislation protecting the privacy of women and children before session\u2019s end.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">For years, Lauryn had been fighting for transgender rights, yet rarely had she felt so defeated. Fatigued, she found herself regularly crying. \u201cIt\u2019s just... I\u2019m tired,\u201d Lauryn said. \u201cSuch a horrible session.\u201d In recent months, Lauryn had also been fielding personal attacks at her home, including an incident where someone broke the window of a car parked in the street and scrawled \u201cfag\u201d on the dusty exterior. These kind of things had happened before, particularly during Lauryn\u2019s efforts to amend San Antonio\u2019s nondiscrimination ordinance to include protections for sexual orientation and gender identity. Now, it felt more personal.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">Then, on May 21, the news broke that legislators would be attaching bathroom language on a school safety bill, a move that would only affect public schools. This time, Lauryn stayed home. She felt guilty, but she and Kerry had already planned out a day with their grandson, Austin. She wouldn\u2019t cancel, not this time. And so Lauryn pulled up a live broadcast from the House floor on a computer, along with a golf tournament to \u201ckeep from going crazy.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">She watched as legislators eventually passed the bathroom amendment, then a House version of the child welfare bill that she had testified against. Lawmakers called and texted Lauryn from the House floor, telling her they had done all they could. At this point, on what she later called \u201cbloody bathroom Sunday,\u201d she had run out of tears. She wondered if she had wasted all those years advocating for a lost cause, if transgender kids were now suffering the consequences of trans people living their lives publicly, proudly. <i>What a wasted life</i>, she thought.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">At times, Kerry worried about the emotional and physical toll everything was having on Lauryn. But she was also deeply proud of her wife and how ardently she was fighting for transgender children. The couple had watched Catizia let go of so much anger and fear once she transitioned. They had watched Catizia become a striking young woman.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p style=\"\">They wanted that for all transgender children.</p><p style=\"\"> <br></p><p

It was a quarter past 2 in the morning, and instead of sleeping at home in San Antonio, she was in the depths of the Texas Capitol, waiting to say her piece.</p> <br> <p>For 15 hours, Lauryn had listened as hundreds of people testified for \u2014 and, overwhelmingly, against \u2014 a Senate \u201cbathroom bill.\u201d     <br> </p> <p>There was a pastor, also from San Antonio, who said that gender, like race, was one of life\u2019s \u201cimmutables.\u201d There was a contingent of unhappy families from Dripping Springs, where the school district had allowed a transgender girl to use the girls\u2019 restroom. There were numerous transgender Texans and their families, who publicly shared intimate details of their lives as they asked lawmakers to vote against the bill.     <br> </p> <p>And then there was Farris, a 60-year-old transgender activist from San Antonio, whose turn it finally was to sit before the Senate committee.     <br> </p> <p>By this hour, no one seemed to be listening. It felt futile, like the decision had already been made about Senate Bill 6, which would require transgender people to use the bathrooms in public schools and government buildings that match the gender on their birth certificate. But Farris would speak anyway, at least for the record\u2019s sake. After all, this wasn\u2019t just about her \u2014 in her mind, it was about a national fight for the rights of all transgender people, including the transgender girl she adopted from the foster care system. She looked down at her notes and cleared her throat.     <br> </p> <p>\u201cI am a Christian. I am the Alamo Region coordinator for the Transgender Education Network of Texas, a grandmother, a biological parent, an adoptive parent, and a lifelong allergy sufferer \u2014 my sympathies are with you,\u201d Farris said, eliciting laughter for her reference to Sen. Joan Huffman\u2019s congestion that night. \u201cAnd those identities identify me much more than the fact that I am also a transgender woman.\u201d If you wanted, she added, you could call her a father, too, but at her core she was just a parent.     <br> </p> <p>By the time Farris got home, the panel had voted 8-1 in favor of the bill. The next month, in an astoundingly similar scene, Farris would testify once again after 2 a.m., against another bathroom bill, this time in the House.     <br> </p> <p> </p> <atavist-simple-image class=\"atavist-simple-image atavist-shared atavist-block atavist-block-align-center\" data-assets=\"https://atavist.com/data/files/organization/61567/image/derivative/scale~1200x0~sb6hearing-1494966080-66.jpg,https://atavist.com/data/files/organization/61567/image/derivative/scale~800x0~sb6hearing-1494966080-66.jpg,https://atavist.com/data/files/organization/61567/image/derivative/scale~400x0~sb6hearing-1494966080-66.jpg\" atavist-block=\"true\" block_id=\"1486318\" block_type=\"atavist-simple-image\" audio_color_scheme=\"white\" the_image=\"{&quot;temp_path&quot;:null,&quot;filename&quot;:&quot;sb6hearing-1494966080-66.jpg&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:3600,&quot;height&quot;:2151,&quot;focal_point&quot;:{&quot;x&quot;:50,&quot;y&quot;:50},&quot;progress&quot;:0,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/data/files/organization/61567/image/raw/sb6hearing-1494966080-66.jpg&quot;}\" the_caption=\"On March 7 and into the next morning, a Senate&amp;nbsp;panel&amp;nbsp;listened to hours of testimony from hundreds of people, many of whom fiercely opposed Senate Bill 6, known as the bathroom bill.

This session, lawmakers filed two dozen bills that advocates fear would harm the LGBTQ community, including a pair of bills that would legislate bathroom use by transgender people.     <br> </p> <p>In some cases, questions over how to define gender has even bled into unrelated legislation, including one that would regulate ride-hailing companies. Lawmakers and proponents of the bathroom bills argue the legislation will protect the privacy and safety of women and children. But in marathon hearings that extended into the early morning hours, hundreds of transgender people and their families pleaded with lawmakers to not discriminate against them.     <br> </p> <custom-block-57058e83420be class=\"custom-block-57058e83420be atavist-shared atavist-block initialized atavist-block-align-right\" data-assets=\"\" atavist-block=\"true\" block_id=\"1486450\" block_type=\"custom-block-57058e83420be\" the_embed=\"<div class=&quot;infogram-embed&quot; data-id=&quot;transgender_statistics&quot; data-type=&quot;interactive&quot; data-title=&quot;Transgender statistics&quot;></div><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n=&quot;InfogramEmbeds&quot;,o=e.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),d=o[0],r=/^http:/.test(e.location)?&quot;http:&quot;:&quot;https:&quot;;if(/^\\/{2}/.test(i)&amp;&amp;(i=r+i),window[n]&amp;&amp;window[n].initialized)window[n].process&amp;&amp;window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var a=e.createElement(&quot;script&quot;);a.async=1,a.id=s,a.src=i,d.parentNode.insertBefore(a,d)}}(document,0,&quot;infogram-async&quot;,&quot;//e.infogr.am/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js&quot;);</script>\" data-alignment=\"right\" contenteditable=\"false\"></custom-block-57058e83420be> <p>Over the past several years, increased visibility of transgender people in pop culture, media and politics has been coupled with a steep rise in anti-LGBTQ legislation nationwide, advocates say. To those fighting against these bills, what happened in North Carolina after the passage and repeal of a bathroom bill there, and what is happening now in Texas, represent the next frontier for advancing civil rights.     <br> </p> <p>For transgender Texans, the political vitriol only magnifies the personal challenges many already face. Transgender people must navigate an uncertain landscape as they seek acceptance from family, friends and co-workers. Some are bullied. Others fear for their physical safety, including \u2014 and at times, especially \u2014 when they walk into bathrooms. About 40 percent of transgender individuals have a history of suicide attempts, and about the same proportion of homeless youth identify as LGBTQ. To transition, they must overcome legal and medical barriers, both of which can be costly or even prohibitive for those who are low-income. And, they face the difficult task of living alongside those who believe they have chosen to be this way.     <br> </p> <p>After months of debate, hours upon hours of public testimony, countless press conferences and news stories, some transgender Texans have been left wondering if the state they call home, the state so intent on protecting women and children, is willing to protect them, too. Even though the bathroom bills seem dead, even if none of the other proposed legislation becomes law, the rhetoric has taken a toll on transgender Texans. Advocates like Farris feel as if they are on the cusp of advancing society and the lives of transgender people, but some are asking themselves: How much will it hurt first?     <br> </p> <p>\u201cWe made so much progress, and then you have just a few people in the world who for whatever reason have the beliefs they have,\u201d Farris said. \u201cSo we just fight harder.\u201d     <br> </p><p></p><atavist-simple-video class=\"atavist-simple-video atavist-shared atavist-block atavist-block-align-full\" data-assets=\"\" atavist-block=\"true\" block_id=\"1492188\" block_type=\"atavist-simple-video\" multi_video=\"{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;vimeo&quot;,&quot;vimeo_url&quot;:&quot;https://vimeo.com/217586907&quot;}\" the_caption=\"\" data-alignment=\"full\" contenteditable=\"false\"></atavist-simple-video><p></p><p><br></p> <p> </p>  <h2>Heightened visibility, and backlash</h2> <p>Three years ago, when transgender actress Laverne Cox appeared on the cover of Time magazine, it seemed like a watershed moment for the transgender community. Here was a black transgender woman who was acting in a popular Netflix show, the first transgender person to grace the publication\u2019s cover. Later that year, Amazon fully premiered the first season of the show \u201cTransparent,\u201d which portrays a family as the father begins transitioning to a woman late in life. Then, in mid-2015, Caitlyn Jenner appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair, about the same time that the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The next year, the Obama administration directed public schools to allow transgender youth to use the bathrooms matching their gender identity. That directive would be rescinded after President Donald Trump took office.     <br> </p> <p>In a short time, public awareness of transgender people had come a long way. But while they enjoyed more visibility than ever, that did not necessarily translate into tangible legal protections. Federal discrimination laws still do not explicitly protect transgender people, though some courts and agencies have interpreted \u201csex\u201d to include gender identity.     <br> </p> <p>On top of that, the legislative attacks began. In 2016, the Human Rights Campaign identified about 200 anti-LGBTQ bills filed by state legislators nationwide, the most notorious of which was North Carolina\u2019s House Bill 2. In a sweeping move, the law nullified local nondiscrimination ordinances that provided protections for trans people using public restrooms. Over the next year, backlash to the law mounted as North Carolina drew the ire of businesses, professional sports leagues and the NCAA. Companies and celebrities boycotted the state. California legislators passed a law banning the use of state funds for travel to states with perceived anti-LGBTQ laws.     <br> </p>  <p>     </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><custom-block-5910f36337bd3 class=\"custom-block-5910f36337bd3 atavist-shared atavist-block atavist-block-align-full\" data-assets=\"\" atavist-block=\"true\" block_id=\"1492192\" block_type=\"custom-block-5910f36337bd3\" multi_video=\"{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;vimeo&quot;,&quot;vimeo_url&quot;:&quot;https://vimeo.com/218066396&quot;}\" the_caption=\"\" the_pullquote=\"<i style=&quot;&quot;>\u201cI am a Christian.

In April 2016, Lt. Gov.

This goes against common sense and common decency,\u201d the petition declared. Patrick soon delivered on his promise to make bathrooms a priority. In January, he unveiled Texas\u2019 own bathroom bill, Senate Bill 6, by and large setting the tone for the session. Authored by Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, R-Brenham, the bill would limit bathroom use in public facilities, including public schools, by the gender listed on a person\u2019s birth certificate. Public safety, he said, was paramount.     <br> </p> <p>\u201cWe know we\u2019re on the right side of the issue.

The legislation largely fell into three major categories: religious refusal bills, which allowed denial of services based on \u201csincerely held religious beliefs\u201d; so-called bathroom bills, which sought to legislate public accommodations; and bills that would invalidate nondiscrimination ordinances that provide local protections for the LGBTQ community.     <br> </p> <p><b>Click <a href=\"https://infogr.am/transgender_legislation_test\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"regular-link\">here</a> to see the status of legislation affecting LGBTQ Texans</b></p><p>A few didn\u2019t, such as a bill that would allow the University Interscholastic League to disqualify student athletes using steroids, barring a \u201cvalid medical purpose.\u201d The bill was filed after Mack Beggs, a 17-year-old transgender boy from Euless, made national headlines in February when he won the state girls\u2019 wrestling title after being prohibited from competing against boys.

They had to move the meeting place to the Scottish Rite Theater when more than three times the number of expected participants signed up. A sheet of paper taped to the door of a multi-stall restroom declared it a gender inclusive bathroom, to be used by anyone throughout the day. Transgender people, their families, and local and national advocates gathered underneath a ceiling adorned with blue stars and ornate red trim as a series of speakers explained how to effectively lobby and offered words of encouragement.     <br> </p> <p>\u201cTexas is on the front lines for the battle for trans equality right now,\u201d McBride told the room.     <br> </p> <p>\u201cSB 6 is not the only thing we need to watch,\u201d said Lou Weaver, the transgender programs coordinator for Equality Texas, as he listed other \u201cbad\u201d bills. \u201cThese are the scary ones, folks.\u201d     <br> </p> <p>During the orientation, the news broke that the Supreme Court had remanded the case of Gavin Grimm, a transgender boy who sued his Virginia school board after it passed a policy that prevented him from using the boys\u2019 restroom. What would happen next, explained Rebecca Robertson, legal and policy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, is the case returns to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, \u201cand we keep fighting.\u201d     <br> </p> <p>Later in the day, as they wandered the hallways of the Capitol, families encountered legislative aides who told them discrimination was \u201cin the eye of the beholder.\u201d Advocates who repeatedly asked to see Sen. Eddie Lucio Jr., the sole Senate Democrat to support the bathroom bill, found that when they left his offices, several Department of Public Safety officers arrived in their wake, reportedly in response to a noise complaint.     <br> </p> <p> </p> <atavist-simple-video class=\"atavist-simple-video atavist-shared atavist-block atavist-block-align-center\" data-assets=\"\" atavist-block=\"true\" block_id=\"1487022\" block_type=\"atavist-simple-video\" the_caption=\"\" multi_video=\"{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;vimeo&quot;,&quot;vimeo_url&quot;:&quot;https://vimeo.com/217916476&quot;}\" contenteditable=\"false\"></atavist-simple-video> <p>The next day, the energized mood of the lobby day shifted. Introducing SB 6 to a Senate panel, Kolhorst insisted the bill was \u201cnondiscriminatory,\u201d that it would increase privacy in intimate spaces. \u201cI\u2019m proud to offer this bill to try to strike a balance, to protect, defend and give a dignified way as to how we move forward,\u201d she said.     <br> </p> <p>As the hearing stretched from 8 a.m. until 4 a.m. the next day, hundreds of people, many of them transgender, testified and registered against the bill. Many were emotional as they explained how damaging such a law would be for transgender people, especially transgender children.     <br> </p> <p>Only several dozen witnesses signaled their support.     <br> </p> <h2>Gender debate divides the Legislature</h2> <p>Even as SB 6 enjoyed early momentum, it languished after passing the Senate in March. House Speaker Joe Straus repeatedly dismissed the issue as a low priority. But other lawmakers seemed intent on passing some form of bathroom legislation.     <br> </p> <p>As SB 6 stalled, Rep. Ron Simmons promoted House Bill 2899 as a compromise to the other bill\u2019s harsh language. Simmons\u2019 bill would prohibit cities and school districts from protecting against discrimination in bathrooms, nullifying portions of nondiscrimination ordinances and policies. Gov. Greg Abbott, who had remained mostly mum on the issue, announced that he would be happy to see Simmons\u2019 bill on his desk.     <br> </p> <p> </p> <p>In April, transgender Texans testified yet again into the early morning hours, in a hearing that did not adjourn until shortly before 5 a.m. The mother of a transgender girl from North Texas had her sleeping child slung across her back while she spoke. A transgender man from San Antonio explained the trauma he endured when he was raped in high school. Farris explained how she used to be so fearful of bathrooms, and how she didn\u2019t want that for the next generation of transgender kids.     <br> </p> <p>The House panel never voted on the bill, and it died in committee in early May. The other bathroom bill died too, as House leaders refused to assign it to a committee. But lawmakers were not ready to give up. Simmons said he intends to push to include language from HB 2899 in amendments to other bills before the session ends on May 29. Earlier this week, Abbott and Patrick signaled that they wanted to see a bathroom bill pass by the session\u2019s end. <br> </p> <p>Meanwhile, other bills advanced. Late at night on May 9, the House passed House Bill 3859, which would allow child welfare providers to turn away prospective adoptive or foster parents, including those who are LGBTQ, based on religious beliefs. The legislation did not occur in a vacuum \u2014 this year, the Department of Family and Protective Services removed language from the \u201cbill of rights\u201d for foster care children that ensured fair treatment regardless of gender identity and sexual orientation.     <br> </p> <p> </p> <p></p> <custom-block-5910f36337bd3 class=\"custom-block-5910f36337bd3 atavist-shared atavist-block atavist-block-align-full\" data-assets=\"\" atavist-block=\"true\" block_id=\"1486454\" block_type=\"custom-block-5910f36337bd3\" the_caption=\"\" the_pullquote=\"<i style=&quot;&quot;>\u201cWhile people struggle with sexual orientation and gender identity, it is no different than people struggling with other kinds of challenges in life.\u201d</i>\" the_attribution=\"- Pastor Charles Flowers, San Antonio\" multi_video=\"{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;vimeo&quot;,&quot;vimeo_url&quot;:&quot;https://vimeo.com/218032056&quot;}\" contenteditable=\"false\"></custom-block-5910f36337bd3> <p>     <br> </p> <h2>The battle continues</h2> <p>On the drive back to San Antonio after testifying against SB 6, Farris felt numb, drained.

rode back with her discussed how they could better educate people on transgender issues, how they could change people\u2019s minds.     <br> </p> <p>Farris did not get home until after 5 a.m., three days after she had left home to spearhead the lobby day.     <br> </p> <p>A few hours later, Farris picked up her phone and got back to work.     <br> </p>
