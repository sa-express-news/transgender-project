It was a quarter past 2 o\u2019clock in the morning, and instead of sleeping at home in San Antonio, she was in the depths of the Texas Capitol, waiting to say her piece. Farris had waited for 18 hours, listening as hundreds of people testified for \u2014 and, overwhelmingly, against \u2014 a Senate \u201cbathroom bill.\u201d</p><p> <br></p><p>There was a pastor, also from San Antonio, who said that gender, like race, was part of life\u2019s \u201cimmutables.\u201d There was a contingent of unhappy families from Dripping Springs, where the school district had allowed a transgender girl to use the girls\u2019 restroom. There were numerous transgender Texans and their families, who publicly shared intimate details of their lives as they asked lawmakers to vote against the bill. And then there was Farris, a 60-year-old transgender activist from San Antonio, whose turn it finally was to sit before the Senate committee.</p><p> <br></p><p>By this hour, no one seemed to be listening. It felt futile, like the decision had already been made about Senate Bill 6, which would require bathroom use in public schools and government buildings align with the gender listed on a person\u2019s birth certificate. But Farris would speak anyways, at least for the record\u2019s sake. After all, this wasn\u2019t just about her \u2014 in her mind, it was about a national fight for the rights of all trans people, including the transgender girl she adopted from the foster care system. She looked down at her notes and cleared her throat.</p><p> <br></p><p>\u201cI am a Christian. I am the Alamo Region coordinator for the Transgender Education Network of Texas, a grandmother, a biological parent, an adoptive parent, and a lifelong allergy sufferer \u2014 my sympathies are with you,\u201d Farris said, eliciting laughter for her reference to Sen. Joan Huffman\u2019s congestion that evening. \u201cAnd those identities identify me much more than the fact that I am also a transgender woman.\u201d If you wanted, she added, you could call her a father too, but at her core she was just a parent.</p><p> <br></p><p>By the time Farris got home, the panel had voted 8-1 in favor of the bill. The next month, in an astoundingly similar scene, Farris would testify once again after 2 a.m., against another bathroom bill, this time in the House.</p><p> <br></p><p>Long days and late nights have become the norm for Farris and other transgender advocates in Texas, where the debate over gender identity has taken center stage. This session, lawmakers filed two dozen bills that advocates fear would harm the LGBTQ community, including a pair of bills that would legislate bathroom use for transgender people. In some cases, questions over how to define gender has even bled into unrelated legislation, including one that would regulate ride-hailing companies. Lawmakers and proponents of the bathroom bills argue the legislation will protect the privacy and safety of women and children. But in marathon hearings that extended into the early morning hours, hundreds of transgender people and their families pleaded with lawmakers to not discriminate against them.</p><p> </p><atavist-simple-video class=\"atavist-simple-video atavist-shared atavist-block atavist-block-align-center\" data-assets=\"\" contenteditable=\"false\" atavist-block=\"true\" block_id=\"1483493\" block_type=\"atavist-simple-video\" multi_video=\"{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;vimeo&quot;,&quot;vimeo_url&quot;:&quot;https://vimeo.com/217586907/&quot;}\" the_caption=\"\"></atavist-simple-video><p><br></p><p>Over the past several years, increased visibility for transgender people in pop culture, media and politics has been coupled with a steep rise in anti-LGBTQ legislation nationwide, advocates say. To those fighting against these bills, what happened in North Carolina after the passage and repeal of a bathroom bill there, and what is happening now in Texas, represents the next frontier for advancing civil rights.</p><p> <br></p><p>For transgender Texans, the political vitriol only magnifies the personal challenges many already face. Transgender people must navigate an uncertain landscape as they seek acceptance from family, friends, co-workers. Some are bullied. Others fear for their physical safety, including \u2014 and at times, especially \u2014 when they walk into bathrooms. About 40 percent of trans individuals have a history of suicide attempts, and about the same proportion of homeless youth identify as LGBT. To transition, they must overcome legal and medical barriers, both of which can be costly or even prohibitive for those who are low-income. Most of all, they face the difficult task of living alongside those who still believe they have chosen to be this way.</p><p> <br></p><p>After months of debate, hours upon hours of public testimony, countless press conferences and news stories, some transgender Texans have been left wondering if the state they call home, the state so intent on protecting women and children, is willing protect them, too. Even as the bathroom bills died, even if none of the other proposed legislation becomes law, the rhetoric has taken a toll on trans Texans. Advocates like Farris feel as if they are on the cusp of advancing society and the lives of transgender people, but some are asking themselves: How much will it hurt first?</p><p> <br></p><p>\u201cWe made so much progress, and then you have just a few people in the world who for whatever reason have the beliefs they have,\u201d Farris said. \u201cSo we just fight harder.\u201d</p><p> <br></p><p>***</p><p> <br></p><p>Three years ago, when transgender actress Laverne Cox appeared on the cover of Time magazine, it seemed like a watershed moment for the transgender community. Here was a black transgender woman who was starring on a popular Netflix show, the first openly transgender person to grace the publication\u2019s cover. Earlier that year, Amazon had debuted the show \u201cTransparent,\u201d which portrays a family as the father begins transitioning to a woman late in life. Then, in mid-2015, Caitlyn Jenner appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair, around the same time that the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. Also that year, the Obama administration directed public schools to allow trans youth to use the bathrooms matching their gender identity. That directive would be rescinded when Donald Trump took office.</p><p> <br></p><p>In a short time, public awareness of transgender people had come a long way. But while they enjoyed more visibility than ever, that did not necessarily translate into tangible legal protections. Federal discrimination laws still do not explicitly protect transgender people, though some courts have interpreted \u201csex\u201d to include gender identity.</p><p> <br></p><p>On top of that, the legislative attacks began. In 2016, HRC identified more than 200 anti-LGBT bills filed by state legislators nationwide, the most notorious of which was North Carolina\u2019s House Bill 2. In a sweeping move, the law nullified all local nondiscrimination ordinances that provided protections for trans people using public restrooms. Over the next year, backlash to the law mounted as North Carolina drew the ire of businesses, professional sports leagues and the NCAA. Companies and celebrities boycotted the state. California legislators passed a law banning the use of state funds for travel to states with perceived anti-LGBTQ laws.</p><p> <br></p><p>\u201cAfter the success of marriage equality, anti-equality politicians were sort of looking for their next boogeyman \u2014 the next group of people that they could target and demonize in order to attract votes,\u201d said Sarah McBride, national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign and the first transgender person to address a major political convention.</p><p> <br></p><p>Even as North Carolina continued to be the subject of wide criticism, Texas Republicans were ready to follow suit. In August 2016, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick launched a petition asking Texans to \u201csay \u2018no\u2019 to men in women\u2019s restrooms.\u201d</p><p> <br></p><p>\u201cFort Worth ISD\u2019s superintendent has unilaterally imposed a new policy allowing boys into girls\u2019 restrooms and locker rooms. This goes against common sense and common decency,\u201d the petition declared. Patrick soon delivered on his promise to make bathrooms a priority. In January, he unveiled Texas\u2019 own bathroom bill, Senate Bill 6, by and large setting the tone for the session. Authored by Sen. Lois Kolkhorst of Brenham, the bill would limit bathroom use in public facilities, including public schools, by the gender listed on a person\u2019s birth certificate. Public safety, he said, was paramount.</p><p> <br></p><p>\u201cWe know we\u2019re on the right side of the issue. We\u2019re on the right side of history,\u201d Patrick said at a news conference. \u201cYou can mark today as the day Texas is drawing a line in the sand and saying no.\u201d</p><p> <br></p><p>***</p><p> <br></p><p>By early March, Texas lawmakers had filed two dozen bills that advocacy groups decried as discriminatory. The legislation largely fell into three main categories: religious refusal bills, which allowed denial of services based on \u201csincerely held religious beliefs\u201d; so-called bathroom bills, which sought to legislate public accommodations; and bills that would invalidate nondiscrimination ordinances that provide local protections for the LGBTQ community.</p><p> <br></p><p>A few didn\u2019t, such as a bill that would allow the University Interscholastic League to disqualify student athletes using steroids, barring a \u201cvalid medical purpose.\u201d The bill was filed after Mack Beggs, a 17-year-old trans boy from Euless, made national headlines in February when he won the state girls\u2019 wrestling title after being prohibited from competing against boys. In May, the Senate gave the legislation preliminary approval.</p><p> <br></p><p>On March 6, the day before the SB 6 hearing, hundreds of activists and allies from across the state gathered for Trans Texan Lobby Day, organized this year by Farris. Organizers had to move the meeting place to the Scottish Rite Theater when more than three times the number of expected participants signed up. A sheet of paper taped to the door of a multi-stall restroom declared it a gender neutral bathroom, to be used by men and women alike throughout the day. Trans people, their families, and local and national advocates gathered underneath a ceiling adorned with blue stars and ornate red trim as a series of speakers explained how to effectively lobby and offered words of encouragement.</p><p> <br></p><p>\u201cTexas is on the front lines for the battle for trans equality right now,\u201d McBride told the room.</p><p> <br></p><p>\u201cSB 6 is not the only thing we need to watch,\u201d said Lou Weaver, the transgender programs coordinator for Equality Texas, as he listed off other \u201cbad\u201d bills. \u201cThese are the scary ones, folks.\u201d</p><p> <br></p><p>During the orientation, the news broke that the U.S. Supreme Court had remanded the case of Gavin Grimm, a trans boy who sued his Virginia school board after it passed a policy that prevented him from using the boys\u2019 restroom. What would happen next, American Civil Liberties Union legal and policy director Rebecca Robertson told the room, \u201cis we go back to the Fourth Circuit and we keep fighting.\u201d</p><p> <br></p><p>Later in the day, as they wandered the hallways of the Capitol, families encountered aides who told them discrimination was \u201cin the eye of the beholder.\u201d Advocates who repeatedly asking to see Sen. Eddie Lucio Jr., the sole Senate Democrat to support the bathroom bill, found that when they left his offices, several Department of Public Safety officers arrived in their wake, reportedly in response to a noise complaint.</p><p> <br></p><p>The next day, the energized mood of the lobby day shifted. Introducing SB 6 to a Senate panel, Kolkhorst insisted the bill was \u201cnondiscriminatory,\u201d that it would increase privacy in intimate spaces. \u201cI\u2019m proud to offer this bill to try to strike a balance, to protect, defend and give a dignified way as to how we move forward,\u201d she said.</p><p> <br></p><p>As the hearing stretched from 8 a.m. until 4 a.m. the next day, hundreds of people, many of them trans, testified and registered against the bill. Many were emotional as they explained how damaging such a law would be for trans people, especially trans children.</p><p> <br></p><p>Only several dozen signaled their support.</p><p> <br></p><p>***</p><p> <br></p><p>Even as SB 6 enjoyed early momentum, it languished after passing the Senate in March. House Speaker Joe Straus repeatedly dismissed the issue as a low priority. But legislators seemed intent on passing some form of bathroom legislation, even if it meant compromising on the vision put forth by Patrick.</p><p> <br></p><p>As SB 6 stalled, Rep. Ron Simmons promoted House Bill 2899 as a \u201ccompromise\u201d to the other bill\u2019s harsh language. Simmons\u2019 bill would prohibit cities and school districts from protecting against discrimination in bathrooms, nullifying portions of nondiscrimination ordinances and policies. Gov. Greg Abbott, who had remained mostly mum on the issue, announced that he would be happy to see Simmons\u2019 bill on his desk.</p><p> <br></p><p>In April, trans people testified yet again into the early morning hours, in a hearing that did not adjourn until shortly before 5 a.m. The mother of a transgender girl from North Texas had her sleeping child slung across her back while she spoke. A transgender man from San Antonio explained the trauma he endured when he was raped in high school. Farris explained how she used to be so fearful of bathrooms, and how she didn\u2019t want that for the next generation of transgender kids.</p><p> <br></p><p>The House panel never voted on the bill, and it died in committee in early May. The other bathroom bill died too, as House leaders refused to assign it to a House committee. But lawmakers were not ready to give up. Simmons said he intends to push to include language from HB 2899 in amendments to other bills before the session ends on May 29.</p><p> <br></p><p>Meanwhile, other bills advanced. Late at night on May 9, the House passed House Bill 3859, which would allow child welfare providers to turn away prospective adoptive or foster parents, including those who are LGBTQ, based on religious beliefs. The legislation did not occur in a vacuum \u2014 this year, the Department of Family and Protective Services removed language from the \u201cbill of rights\u201d for foster care children that ensures fair treatment regardless of gender identity and sexual orientation.</p><p> <br></p><p>***</p><p> <br></p><p>On the drive back to San Antonio after testifying against SB 6, Farris felt numb, drained. She had been deeply moved by the stories of other transgender Texans, but she was also amazed that some people could hate her, without even knowing her.</p><p> <br></p><p>She and another transgender activist who rode back with her discussed how they could better educate people on trans issues, how they could change people\u2019s minds.</p><p> <br></p><p>Farris did not get home until after 5 a.m., three days after she had left home to spearhead the lobby day.</p><p> <br></p><p>At 7:30 a.m., Farris picked up the phone and got back to work.</p><p> <br></p><p><i>lcaruba@express-news.net</i></p><p>

Across the street, workers in hardhats tromped about.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>The women waltzed into the empty living room and commenced to marvel. Even though everything was coated in a fine film of dust, the amenities stood out: Spacious rooms. Tall windows that let in golden light. A room with a washer and dryer. Kitchen countertops that looked like real granite.     <br> </p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>\u201cGet a load of that backsplash,\u201d Louden said, noting an ornate plaster design above the sink.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>The women were here to see if Louden, 67, a retired sales coordinator, and her two great-grandchildren might find a home at East Meadows. Louden, who lived in Austin most of her life but grew up on the East Side, retired two years ago and lives not far away from the new building. She\u2019d \u201cheard great things\u201d about what was happening in the neighborhood.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Those \u201cgreat things\u201d include the creation of East Meadows, the first phase of a $100 million, 400-unit \u201cmixed-income\u201d residential development that is the most ambitious attempt by the San Antonio Housing Authority to fight concentrated poverty. SAHA has spent government funds before to create upscale-looking homes on the historically neglected East Side, developments that mix low-income and middle- and upper-income tenants on the theory that such diversity brings opportunity to blighted areas and helps lift up the most vulnerable residents.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>But the East Meadows project, which includes a slew of street, sidewalk and other improvements in the surrounding neighborhood as well as social services to help disadvantaged tenants, takes things to a new level. It also sits in the middle of the so-called \u201cfootprint,\u201d a 3.5-square-mile area on the East Side where several federal grants overlap and seek to transform the lives of 18,000 residents with a raft of poverty-fighting measures, from increasing access to early education and improving schools to strengthening families and providing adult workforce training.</p> <p> </p> <atavist-simple-slideshow data-alignment=\"center\" effect=\"slide\" slides=\"[{&quot;slide_image&quot;:{&quot;filename&quot;:&quot;eastmeadows-1489614229-89.jpg&quot;,&quot;progress&quot;:0,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/data/files/organization/61567/image/raw/eastmeadows-1489614229-89.jpg&quot;,&quot;temp_path&quot;:null,&quot;width&quot;:2000,&quot;height&quot;:1333,&quot;focal_point&quot;:{&quot;x&quot;:50,&quot;y&quot;:50}},&quot;slide_title&quot;:&quot;<p>Julian Castro, then secretary&amp;nbsp;of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, tours an apartment in October at East Meadows, a new affordable housing development that stands as a vast improvement over&amp;nbsp;Wheatley Courts, a 1940s-era housing project that was demolished to make room for the 200-plus new apartments.</p>&quot;,&quot;n&quot;:0},{&quot;n&quot;:1,&quot;slide_image&quot;:{&quot;filename&quot;:&quot;eastmeadows-1489615430-30.jpg&quot;,&quot;progress&quot;:0,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/data/files/organization/61567/image/raw/eastmeadows-1489615430-30.jpg&quot;,&quot;temp_path&quot;:null,&quot;width&quot;:2000,&quot;height&quot;:1333,&quot;focal_point&quot;:{&quot;x&quot;:50,&quot;y&quot;:50}},&quot;slide_title&quot;:&quot;<p>As they await the ribbon-cutting for East Meadows, a modern, mixed-income housing development built on the site of a former derelict housing project on the East Side, members of the Wheatley Middle School Leadership Officer Training Corps  stand in their school T-shirts.

That same year, nearly $1 million in grants was awarded to bring down a high crime rate and increase public safety.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>The year before, the U.S. Department of Education gave a $23.7 million Promise grant to the United Way of San Antonio and Bexar County to improve education and provide social services to the historically black but now Hispanic majority area, which has been rebranded as EastPoint by the city. The Promise grant sought to revitalize an area where the poverty rate is 40 percent or higher, double that of the city itself.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Among major cities, San Antonio has one of the worst rates of concentrated poverty and income segregation in the country, a topic recently explored in <a href=\"http://projects.expressnews.com/stoeltje-worlds-apart-poverty-income-inequality-bexar\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"regular-link\"><b>Worlds Apart</b></a>, a special report by the Express-News.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>The first phase of East Meadows, scheduled to be done in May, will be followed by two more phases designed for seniors, disabled people and additional families. The rest of the money for the project comes from $20 million in federal funds passed through the city, low-income housing tax credits and other money.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Since the grants were awarded, the city has kicked in another $45 million in 2012 bond money and $6 million in street maintenance funds in the Promise Zone, which includes $6.5 million in bond money for the creation of a $10 million linear park along Menger Creek, which also received $2.8 million in Bexar County flood control funds. An $8.1 million health clinic is in the works.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>After President Obama in 2014 declared a larger, 22-square-mile area surrounding East Point as a Promise Zone, a designation that confers no money but gives groups an edge in applying for federal funds, another $17 million flowed to nonprofits, which set up charter schools, economic development programs and other projects.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>The area surrounding East Meadows is clearly a neighborhood in transition. Boarded-up houses are in sight of sleek new lofts ready-made for millennials and young professionals, as private developers have poured more than $200 million into the gentrifying neighborhoods around the complex. More than 200 businesses have opened on the East and near-East Side since 2011, according to city records. A developer recently announced plans for an eight-acre, $150 million mixed-use project in Denver Heights, a gentrifying neighborhood just south of the Alamodome.</p> <atavist-embed the_caption=\"\" raw_embed=\"<iframe src='//cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1wN7im0Th5Z8RfEWd8Pm_eGU8ge3QK-CnqDwlSL0OUcU&amp;font=Default&amp;lang=en&amp;initial_zoom=2&amp;height=650' width='100%' height='650' frameborder='0'></iframe>\" cdn.knightlab.com=\"\" libs=\"\" timeline3=\"\" latest=\"\" embed=\"\" index.html?source=\"1wN7im0Th5Z8RfEWd8Pm_eGU8ge3QK-CnqDwlSL0OUcU&amp;font=Default&amp;lang=en&amp;initial_zoom=2&amp;height=650\" '=\"\" width=\"100% \" height=\"650 \" frameborder=\"0 \" class=\"atavist-embed atavist-shared atavist-block atavist-block-align-full\" data-assets=\"\" contenteditable=\"false\" atavist-block=\"true\" block_id=\"1344570\" block_type=\"atavist-embed\" data-alignment=\"full\"></atavist-embed> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Whether all this money will truly turn around an area mired in intergenerational poverty and economic neglect won\u2019t be known for years.

A magnet for professionals, artists, hipsters and those willing to spend big bucks for historic homes, it even has its own millennial-ish moniker, Diggy Hill. Made up of weekly classes over four months, the NLA is an invaluable tool to train residents in how to work with the city to get things done, he said.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about folks taking ownership in their communities and developing leaders,\u201d he said.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>But as volunteer entities, community groups like the NLA and neighborhood associations lack much in the way of permanence, he said. That function falls to city government, which ostensibly will be there as community engagement waxes and wanes.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>In that regard, you can count Dillard among the skeptics.

Their task is to create parachutes that will glide down from a second-story stairwell, a lesson in aerodynamics. As the students manipulate masking tape and white paper, they make notes in their journals, looking like avid amateur scientists.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>The scene is much the same in a third-grade classroom down the hall, where students appear deeply engaged as they create pulleys to move an object. Ditto a fifth-grade classroom, where you can hear the proverbial pin drop as students conduct experiments in submersion science, using marbles and beads.</p> <p> </p>  <p>     <br> </p> <p>The academic alchemy happening inside Bowden, a school where most kids come from low-income families, isn\u2019t the result of luck or happenstance. About four years ago, it and two other public elementary schools on the East Side switched to a project-based model focused on science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, to better prepare students for 21st century work.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>The school changes were part of a larger plan over the last half-decade that pumped $54 million in federal grants into a relatively small area on the East Side, a place with some of the worst poverty rates in San Antonio and long-plagued by high crime, low-performing schools and little economic opportunity. In addition, the city ponied up more than $50 million in federal funds and bond money; the county supplied close to $3 million for a park project. Other money followed.</p> <p>     </p><p><br> </p> <p>The goal was to apply a host of anti-poverty measures to the 3.5 square-mile area \u2014 the so-called \u201cfootprint\u201d \u2014 to see if the lives of residents could be transformed.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>As the grants draw to a close, officials are eager to provide numbers showing the effort has been a resounding success, pointing to gains like more children enrolled in early childhood education. And in that regard, the news seems wholly positive \u2014 more than half of children are now receiving formal early care, and programs are of higher quality.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>But in the broader picture, the results are decidedly mixed. High school graduation rates remain low, as do student reading levels. College-readiness levels are substandard; school scores on standardized state tests have shown only short-term improvement. Families still move around a great deal during the school year, a practice that doesn\u2019t bode well for children.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>One other encouraging measure: Across a broader, 22-square-mile swath of the East Side, poverty has declined, dropping from 35 to 30.9 percent since 2010.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>But in the neighborhoods where most of the action focused, the poverty rate has remained high and flat, fluctuating between 41 and 44 percent. In contrast, San Antonio\u2019s poverty rate is 19.8 percent \u2014 a number that social scientists consider perilously high.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Officials say five years isn\u2019t enough time to turn around neglect that has persisted for decades and that the true scope of the grants\u2019 impact may not reveal itself for years. In the meantime, incremental progress matters, such as the sight of second-graders diligently bending over their science notebooks, immersed in their studies, preparing for a brighter future.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <h2>Buckets of money</h2> <p>     <br> </p> <p>The revitalization effort began in 2011 when the U.S. Department of Education awarded a $23.7 million Promise grant to the United Way of San Antonio and Bexar County to enact initiatives in the so-called Eastside Promise Neighborhood, a historically black but now Hispanic majority area that is home to some 18,000 residents.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>The grant focused on education and social services. Five of the San Antonio Independent School District schools in the targeted area \u2014 one early education center, three elementary schools and a middle school \u2014 switched to a project-based, STEM curricula, shown to be particularly effective for students at low-income schools. In doing so, they followed the lead of nearby Sam Houston High School, which had adopted such a curriculum several years earlier.

Altogether, more than 400 affordable housing units will be built in the area by 2019, at a total cost of $100 million, paid for with the Choice grant, other federal funds passed through the city, low-income housing tax credits and other sources.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Another infusion of federal money came in 2012 when the U.S. Department of Justice awarded two grants to reduce crime in the footprint, which has since been rebranded by the city as EastPoint: a $600,000 Byrne Criminal Justice Innovation grant for the Choice neighborhood and a $320,000 Byrne Public Safety Enhancement grant for the Promise neighborhood.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Altogether, the overlapping grants sought to address poverty at its roots, in effect turning one small sector of the city into a living laboratory for almost every urban poverty-fighting scheme imaginable.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>In 2014, President Obama designated a 22-square-mile area on the East Side as a Promise Zone, one of a handful of \u201cdistressed communities\u201d across the nation where leaders were already working to fight poverty. The 10-year designation, which geographically includes EastPoint, brought no money but gave organizations an edge when applying for federal funds.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Thanks to that help, nonprofits have snagged $17.4 million in federal funding for Promise Zone initiatives, such as the George Gervin Youth Center, which won a $1.1 million grant from the U.S. Department of Labor to provide education and work training to youth who\u2019ve dropped out of school, aged out of foster care or spent time in the juvenile justice system.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>The city provided $20 million in federal block grant funds to prepare the site for East Meadows, for street and infrastructure improvements in the surrounding neighborhood and \u201chousing gap\u201d financing.

Several public schools on the East Side were slated to close in 2009 due to declining enrollment, as residents who could over the years fled to more affluent environs. To halt the exodus, then-Mayor Juli\u00e1n Castro and then-District 2 City Councilwoman Ivy Taylor convened a series of \u201creinvestment summits,\u201d where solutions could be discussed and residents could vent their concerns to civic leaders.</p> <p>     </p><p><br> </p> <p>Their concerns were legion \u2014 piled-up trash, stray dogs, spotty code enforcement, a sense that the city had utterly abandoned the East Side. Residents had a right to be skeptical that the summits would come to any good: Previous promises to bring prosperity to their world \u2014 new sports stadiums, snazzy entertainment developments \u2014 had fallen flat.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>But this time was going to be different, according to officials. The United Way applied for and got a planning grant to be in the running for the Promise grant. A flurry of meetings ensued: work groups, public forums, home visits. A researcher compiled and analyzed data going back years. What they found was insufficiency clotting every aspect of East Side life: Overwhelmed parents. Stressed schools. Lack of safe housing. Little health care. Deficient transportation. Unhealthy food. Nonprofits stuck in silos.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Subcommittees were formed to address particular areas of concern, groups that included experts and nonprofit officials as well as residents. Early on, it was decided early childhood education had to be a focus.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>\u201cThere was very little prekindergarten and quality early childhood education in the neighborhood,\u201d said Mary Ellen Burns, senior vice president of grant implementation for the United Way. \u201cWe saw that if children didn\u2019t receive that early help, by third or fourth grade they were having trouble and by sixth grade they were dropping out.\u201d</p> <p>     </p><p><br> </p> <p>The neighborhood had three nonprofit child care centers, serving children ages 5 and under, as well as a Head Start program at an SAISD public early childhood education center \u2014 Tynan \u2014 and prekindergarten at two of the three footprint elementary schools, Pershing and Bowden. (Prekindergarten and Head Start serves kids ages 3 to 4.) But there weren\u2019t enough slots in the schools, and the centers lacked the resources to provide high-quality programs, Burns said.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>In any case, the majority of young children were kept in informal care \u2014 babysat by friends, relatives \u2014 and not necessarily receiving the kind of input a growing brain needs.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Using grant funds, the United Way, working with SAISD, set about increasing both the quality of education and number of subsidized slots at the centers, expanded prekindergarten to the centers and, eventually, a third elementary school, Washington. Curricula were improved and standardized, as were methods used to track children\u2019s progress. A local bank funded efforts to improve the training of center workers.</p> <p>     </p><p><br> </p> <p>And starting in 2012, the Annie E. Casey Foundation gave small grants to the United Way to launch a partnership to create the so-called Dual Generation initiative at the existing early childhood education centers, culminating in a $1 million per year, seven-year grant in 2015.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>\u201cDual Gen\u201d provides low or no-cost high-quality, all-day early childhood education and after-school care to children ages 10 and under, while simultaneously providing parents with free adult education and workforce training, mostly at a new training center \u2014 called the Eastside Education &amp; Training Center, or EETC \u2014 but at other sites as well, including St. Philip\u2019s College.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>\u201cThe idea is to help the whole family,\u201d said Burns. The grant is renewable at the end of seven years.</p> <atavist-simple-video class=\"atavist-simple-video atavist-shared atavist-block atavist-block-align-center\" data-assets=\"\" contenteditable=\"false\" atavist-block=\"true\" block_id=\"1343896\" block_type=\"atavist-simple-video\" multi_video=\"{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;vimeo&quot;,&quot;vimeo_url&quot;:&quot;https://vimeo.com/208532413/settings/embed&quot;}\" the_caption=\"\" data-alignment=\"center\"></atavist-simple-video><p>     <br> </p> <p>In February 2015, the city received a five-year $7 million federal grant to institute free Early Head Start programs at six local child care centers, two of them in the footprint, another boost to quality of care, said Burns.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Statistics paint a success. At the \u201cbaseline\u201d year of 2013, only about 26 percent of children 5 and under in the footprint were enrolled in formal early child care in any form. By last year, the final year of the grant, that number had risen to more than half, or 940 eligible children out of 1,865. Tynan and the three centers are now at capacity or near-capacity. One center, Healy-Murphy, has received a coveted accreditation status; the other two are on track to do so.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>These numbers, in turn, have birthed other happy statistics.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Before the grant, almost 70 percent of children in the footprint entered kindergarten without the necessary skills. By 2015, 48 percent of 3-year-olds enrolled in Early Head Start in the footprint were found to be developmentally on track. And 41 percent of children in the public kindergarten classes were found to be \u201ckinder-ready,\u201d according to a test that measures children\u2019s ability to meet developmental milestones across five areas upon school enrollment.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>But like with much of the data, these numbers are qualified. Over the same period, the percentage of children in informal child care grew even more, from about 21 percent to 47.8 percent in the neighborhood. (The actual number is likely much higher, since the neighborhood questionnaire defined \u201cinformal care\u201d as homes caring for three or more children.)</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>\u201cIt would be fair to say more people are caring for more children in an informal setting than four years ago,\u201d Burns said. \u201cThis remains a challenge, because the link between formal early care and later academic success is clear.\u201d</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>However, she added, Eastside Promise Neighborhood officials, realizing that informal care is \u201chighly valued\u201d in the community, created family support groups to assist informal caregivers. She couldn\u2019t provide data on whether those supports were increasing kinder-readiness among informally cared-for children because \u201cit\u2019s too early in the process for that. We didn\u2019t kick (the program) off until one year ago.\u201d</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Regarding Dual Gen, it\u2019s not just the kids who benefit. Burns said. Of the 121 parents in the program last year, 49 found full-time work and 85 completed a certificate program or a semester of school. The goal is to place parents into \u201chigh-demand\u201d jobs, she said. Recent graduates have found work as heavy equipment operators, medical assistants and commercial drivers.</p> <p>     </p><p></p><p><br> </p> <p>Tiffane Garza, 28, whose mother grew up in Wheatley Courts, was one of them. Last fall, she\u2019d temporarily moved with her four kids from the East Side to a subsidized West Side duplex, because of problems with her apartment. But her goal was to move back to the East Side, into the upscale-looking East Meadows sometime in the future.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Even though the single mother technically wasn\u2019t living on the East Side, her kids were still gaining from EastPoint initiatives: Two children were reaping STEM benefits at Bowden; two more, ages 1 and 2, were enrolled at Healy-Murphy.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Through Dual Gen, Garza found a part-time job at an apartment leasing office. That success has motivated her to enroll in cosmetology school.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>\u201cI thought I was never going to be able to get on my feet, to have work,\u201d she said, tears sliding down her face. \u201cI don\u2019t want the help to stop. My kids are happy. I\u2019m happy. It\u2019s a blessing.\u201d</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Her children come home from Healy-Murphy bearing worksheets; already they know their numbers and colors, she said proudly.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>United Way officials said efforts are under way to identify funding for the early childhood education programs, in the event the Dual Gen and Early Head Start grants aren\u2019t renewed. What\u2019s more, middle- and high-income \u201cprivate pay\u201d families drawn to an ever-revitalizing East Side will also help keep the centers financially afloat, they said.</p> <p>     </p><atavist-simple-slideshow class=\"slideshow-slide-effect atavist-simple-slideshow atavist-shared atavist-block atavist-block-align-center\" data-assets=\"\" contenteditable=\"false\" atavist-block=\"true\" block_id=\"1343731\" block_type=\"atavist-simple-slideshow\" slides=\"[{&quot;n&quot;:0,&quot;slide_image&quot;:{&quot;filename&quot;:&quot;eastsidepro-1489682773-43.jpg&quot;,&quot;progress&quot;:0,&quot;width&quot;:2000,&quot;height&quot;:1333,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/data/files/organization/61567/image/raw/eastsidepro-1489682773-43.jpg&quot;,&quot;temp_path&quot;:null,&quot;focal_point&quot;:{&quot;x&quot;:50,&quot;y&quot;:50}},&quot;slide_title&quot;:&quot;<p>Tiffane Garza spends the day with two of her four children, Lilly Zuniga, 2, and Julian Zuniga, 1.

The numbers increased despite the fact Promise grant funds were used to bring in City Year AmeriCorps members in 2012 to work specifically with middle and high school students at risk of chronic truancy.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Districts also keep track of their \u201cmobility\u201d rates \u2014 the percentage of students who leave or switch campuses or districts during the school year \u2014 because it\u2019s a good indicator of how stable or unstable their lives are.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Studies show high mobility can cause students to have lower attendance and achievement scores; highly mobile students are twice as likely to repeat a grade and half as likely to graduate from high school as their non-mobile peers.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Officials had hoped mobility rates in the footprint would greatly decline. In the 2012-2013 school year, the average rate across the schools was 33.3 percent \u2014 higher than SAISD\u2019s rate of 25 percent, and much higher than the 18 percent of a comparatively affluent district like Northside ISD.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Over the course of the grant, little progress was observed, with mobility rates staying basically flat, except for minor overall fluctuations.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Burns offered reasons why the rate has proved so stubborn, acknowledging they\u2019re \u201canecdotal,\u201d with no data to back them up. As children benefit and grow because of anti-poverty initiatives, she said, families may decide to move to better neighborhoods and schools. Similarly, as parents gain training and employment, they may decide to move closer to jobs elsewhere.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>The demolition of Wheatley Courts also caused environmental hazards that made it necessary for some of the 205 families living in the courts to leave the footprint to find new housing. Some of the high mobility rate is also undoubtedly linked to \u201ceconomic instability,\u201d such as families being evicted by landlords, she added.</p> <p>     <b><i><a href=\"http://projects.expressnews.com/promises-to-keep#chapter-2160552\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"regular-link\">GRAPHIC: East Side poverty rates</a></i></b></p> <p>Christine Drennon, associate professor of sociology and anthropology at Trinity University, who did the planning research for the Promise grant, said she\u2019s not surprised mobility rates didn\u2019t improve because the grant programs\u2019 focus was misplaced. From the start, she lobbied to spend more money on parent rooms, rather than on early childhood education.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>\u201cOne of the big findings (of her research) was that mobility is a serious problem,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were able to show the impact it has on grades. But (the United Way and others) didn\u2019t even try to put effort there. They didn\u2019t even try to address the mobility issue.\u201d</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Parent rooms provide parents with a range of support, such as workshops, educational enrichment and referrals to emergency assistance and job training. Parent room volunteers conduct door-to-door home visits to find out how kids are doing in school. The whole point of the parent room is to connect the family to the school, and parents to each other. Perhaps most vitally, Drennon said, the rooms are \u201csafe spaces\u201d where parents, often not high school graduates themselves, become comfortable in the school environment, which in turn empowers them to support their kids and create a learning environment at home.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Parent rooms were already in place in the footprint schools before the grant programs started; beefing them up would have helped families form a stronger attachment to their schools, prompting them to stay in place and not disrupt their children\u2019s lives, Drennon said.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>The Promise grant was \u201can invitation for a revolution,\u201d she said.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>\u201cI thought we were going to blow stuff up, then find the best models for inner-city education, get the best minds in the country together,\u201d she said. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t done. There were no new faces on that team.\u201d</p> <p>     </p><p><br> </p> <p>Burns said data and feedback gleaned in the planning process showed early education was the direst need. She added that the United Way spends $1.8 million annually in parent rooms at 28 schools in the city, roughly $386,000 for the six parent rooms in footprint schools. As part of the grant, the agency also created a volunteer parent-advocate position to serve as an adviser on teams that help at-risk students at Wheatley and Sam Houston.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Officials were also hoping to see strides in school state testing scores. The footprint schools were tasked to reach annual \u201cperformance targets\u201d set by the grant. These target scores on the state standardized STAAR test in reading and math were below average state levels but still represented improvement, given that the campuses historically were performing 10 to 22 percentage points below the district scores. During the first three years, the schools met the targets \u2014 with some even earning academic achievement notices \u2014 but then the scores plateaued or dropped in the fourth year.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Judy Ratlief, director of operations for EPN and longtime educator on the East Side, attributed the lagging school performances to increasing rigor in state testing.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>\u201cAcross the board there was a district-wide drop,\u201d in scores, she said. \u201cThese particular schools were not out of the norm.\u201d However, the footprint declines were for the most part steeper than the district drop, which, as far as reading and math scores for fifth- and eighth-graders, was among the lowest in Bexar County.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Even with the decline, all of the footprint schools met state standards last year, except for Wheatley, which scored \u201cimprovement required,\u201d as it has in the past.</p> <p>     </p><p><b><i><a href=\"http://projects.expressnews.com/promises-to-keep#chapter-2160552\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"regular-link\">GRAPHIC: Promise Zone budget</a></i></b></p> <p>Regarding the Promise benchmarks, Wheatley posted the most disappointing showing, Burns said. Part of the problem may lie in the middle school paradigm itself, she said. Starting next year, Wheatley will become home to the Young Men\u2019s Leadership Academy, serving boys in grades 4 through 8. The footprint elementary schools will gradually phase in grades to create a prekindergarten-8th grade model. The move to dismantle middle schools is occurring across the district, given evidence showing students tend to fare better staying at their elementary school, Burns said.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Despite the lagging test numbers, the switch to a STEM-focused-curriculum has been deemed so successful, say grant administrators, that the three elementary schools have begun the process to apply to become in-district STEM charter schools, and SAISD plans to implement aspects of the program district-wide.</p> <p>     </p><p><br> </p> <atavist-simple-slideshow class=\"slideshow-slide-effect atavist-simple-slideshow atavist-shared atavist-block atavist-block-align-center\" data-assets=\"\" contenteditable=\"false\" atavist-block=\"true\" block_id=\"1343823\" block_type=\"atavist-simple-slideshow\" slides=\"[{&quot;n&quot;:0,&quot;slide_image&quot;:{&quot;filename&quot;:&quot;eastsidepro-1489688445-66.jpg&quot;,&quot;progress&quot;:0,&quot;width&quot;:2000,&quot;height&quot;:1333,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/data/files/organization/61567/image/raw/eastsidepro-1489688445-66.jpg&quot;,&quot;temp_path&quot;:null,&quot;focal_point&quot;:{&quot;x&quot;:50,&quot;y&quot;:50}},&quot;slide_title&quot;:&quot;<p>Sylvia Hernandez (from left), Cornelius Coats, Chanice Henderson and Jesse Tavera built Boe-Bot  robots in their robotics class at Sam Houston High School in&amp;nbsp;November.

Case in point: A partnership between the Eastside Promise Neighborhood, Trinity University, SAISD and the Ewing Halsell Foundation that enabled that small fleet of reading teachers, instructional deans, peer-assistant teachers and other support staff to be deployed into footprint schools has reached its end.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Next year, they\u2019ll be replaced by \u201cimplementation specialists\u201d \u2014 one staff person per footprint school who will provide coaching and mentoring to teachers, paid for by SAISD.</p> <p>     </p><p><br> </p> <p>Darnell White, in his eighth year as principal at Sam Houston, isn\u2019t sure that will be enough. But he does know he\u2019s witnessed a new energy within the halls of the iconic school, progress he attributes largely to the Promise grant, with its influx of support staff and other measures.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>The school, once shedding students, has seen enrollment jump from 850 to 1,130 since the grant began. Groups like ROTC, band, engineering club and academic decathlon enjoy robust membership and compete at state and national levels, White said. More students are opting to enroll in college or post-secondary education \u2014 45.8 percent in 2014, versus 44.5 percent in 2013, according to Sam Houston data.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Some of this increase may relate to the fact that Sam Houston gained an engineering magnet program several years before the grant began \u2014 magnet programs tend to draw a more motivated set of students and parents, experts say. (This year, about 8 percent of students hail from outside the footprint; Sam Houston is also a traditional high school with students on a non-magnet track.) In fact, it was the high school\u2019s embrace of a STEM-related curricula that prompted Promise grant officials to switch the \u201cfeeder\u201d elementary schools and Tynan to a STEM-focused format, so that students might be better prepared once they reached Sam Houston.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Last year, SAISD redesigned its high school magnets to closely align with Alamo Colleges\u2019 programs, said Leslie Price, spokeswoman for the district. Since 2010, some Sam Houston students follow a New Tech \u201cschool within a school\u201d model that allows students to earn college credits while in high school.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Promise Zone boosters like to point to Sam Houston\u2019s vastly improved graduation rate as an indication of the federal grant\u2019s impact, but the rise actually began before grant programs started, leaping dramatically in one year, from 57.1 percent in 2010 to 81.1 percent in 2011.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Price attributes some of that significant jump to a host of efforts that have been implemented across the district to keep students in school, such as interventions with at-risk students and a credit recovery course.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>But part of that rise likely owed to a new law that in 2011 began letting districts exclude certain populations of students from drop-out and graduation tallies. Without that policy change, Sam Houston\u2019s 2011 graduation rate would have been 10.4 points lower \u2014 70.7 percent, Price said.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Other factors that may have played a role in upping Sam Houston\u2019s graduation rate include the creation of so-called individual graduation committees during the 2014-2015 school year, which allow students who\u2019ve failed one or two required state tests during their tenure in high school to nonetheless graduate, if their coursework, attendance or other variables are deemed adequate.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>The Sam Houston graduation rate last year was 82.2 percent.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Many in the neighborhood credit the success at Sam Houston to White himself, a dynamic leader by all accounts and a towering presence as he strides the halls of the school.</p><p></p><atavist-simple-image class=\"atavist-simple-image atavist-shared atavist-block atavist-block-align-center\" data-assets=\"https://atavist.com/data/files/organization/61567/image/derivative/scale~1200x0~eastsidepro-1489688728-71.jpg,https://atavist.com/data/files/organization/61567/image/derivative/scale~800x0~eastsidepro-1489688728-71.jpg,https://atavist.com/data/files/organization/61567/image/derivative/scale~400x0~eastsidepro-1489688728-71.jpg\" contenteditable=\"false\" atavist-block=\"true\" block_id=\"1345989\" block_type=\"atavist-simple-image\" audio_color_scheme=\"white\" the_image=\"{&quot;temp_path&quot;:null,&quot;filename&quot;:&quot;eastsidepro-1489688728-71.jpg&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:2000,&quot;height&quot;:1333,&quot;focal_point&quot;:{&quot;x&quot;:50,&quot;y&quot;:50},&quot;progress&quot;:0,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/data/files/organization/61567/image/raw/eastsidepro-1489688728-71.jpg&quot;}\" the_caption=\"Sam Houston High School Principal Darnell White walks around a STEM class in the New Tech program at the school on Nov. 30, 2016.\"></atavist-simple-image><p><br></p> <p>     </p><p></p><atavist-pullquote class=\"atavist-pullquote atavist-shared atavist-block atavist-block-align-center\" data-assets=\"\" contenteditable=\"false\" atavist-block=\"true\" block_id=\"1345828\" block_type=\"atavist-pullquote\" font_size=\"2\" the_pullquote=\"\u201cIt\u2019s never going to go back to the way it was ... not as long as I\u2019m here.\u201d --&amp;nbsp;<i style=&quot;&quot;>Darnell White, in his eighth year as principal at Sam Houston</i>\"></atavist-pullquote><p>But even with all the changes and improvements, White said too many Sam Houston students still read below grade level \u2014 65 percent, according to district data. Last year, only 7 percent of graduates were deemed college ready in reading and math, down from 24 percent the year before. (Schools across the city likewise saw their numbers drop, due to a change in how the Texas Education Agency calculates college readiness, from scores on a state test to the TSIA, a college entrance exam.)<br></p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Promise grant administrators don\u2019t track college-readiness, Burns said, focusing instead on the percent of Sam Houston graduates who are able to start their first year of college without having to take remedial courses \u2014 classes students must take to improve their skills in math and reading before moving on to college classes.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Before the grant began, 22.1 percent of graduates required no remediation; by the class of 2014, that number had improved to 30.5 percent. But by the class of 2015, the number was down to 20.6 percent \u2014 almost as low as when the programs started.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>Burns said the cohort of students in the 2015 school year entered high school further behind academically than most and never caught up, even with \u201cintensive interventions.\u201d Changes have since been put in place that seek to intervene earlier, she said.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>On a more positive note, a healthy percentage of Sam Houston students \u2014 65 percent \u2014 were deemed \u201ccollege and career ready,\u201d a less stringent category that includes graduates who demonstrate preparedness by earning credits in at least two advanced/dual-credit courses as juniors or seniors or who complete a four-year plan of study in career or technical education while in high school. In this category, the graduates nip at the heels of more affluent students in Northside ISD, where 71 percent were deemed college and career ready.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>No matter how you slice the statistics, White\u2019s optimism remains strong.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>\u201cWhat the Eastside Promise Neighborhood was able to do was provide exposure \u2014 not only to expose students to the outside world, through competitions and the like, but to expose the community and larger city to the success going on at Sam Houston,\u201d he said.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>It simply may be too soon to judge the true results of the grant, White said, echoing others. All those kids who at this moment are enrolled in high-quality early childhood education, soaking up all that intellectual stimulation? Who knows what impact they\u2019ll have once they bubble up through the system, he wondered.</p> <p>     <br> </p> <p>One thing White knows for sure about his school.</p> <p>     <br> </p>
